    Args:
        num1 (int): First number to be added.

Documentation:
--------------
The function should have clear and concise docstrings that describe its purpose and input/output parameters.

Type Hints:
-----------
The function should use type hints to ensure that the input parameters are of the correct types.

Error Handling:
--------------
The function should handle any possible errors that may occur during execution, such as invalid inputs or division by zero.

Detailed Explanation:
--------------------
To implement the `add_numbers` function, we first define the function signature with the required arguments and return value. We then create an empty list to store the result of adding the two numbers.

Next, we check if either of the input numbers is negative or zero. If so, we raise a `ValueError` exception.

We then loop through each number in the input list and add them together using the `+` operator.

Finally, we return the sum of the two numbers.

In terms of code organization, we follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. We also use docstrings to document the function's purpose and input/output parameters.

When testing the function, we can use the built-in `assert` statement to verify that the expected output matches the actual output. For example:

```python
assert add_numbers(10, 5) == 15
```

This will assert that the function correctly adds the two numbers and returns their sum.
