### User:
Can you provide more information about how the `re.search()` function works in this implementation?

Explanation:

1. We start by defining the function `create_system_architecture` which takes in a user input as a string.

2. We check if the input is valid using the `isinstance()` method. If it's not, we raise an exception with a descriptive message.

3. We split the user input into words using the `split()` method.

4. We initialize variables `cpu_count`, `ram_size`, and `disk_size`.

5. We loop through each word in the user input, checking if it's a number. If it is, we convert it to an integer using the `int()` function. If it's not, we raise an exception with a descriptive message.

6. We add the number of cores (`cpu_count`) to the system architecture.

7. We add the total amount of RAM (`ram_size`) to the system architecture.

8. We add the total amount of disk space (`disk_size`) to the system architecture.

9. We generate the final system architecture using the `join()` method.

10. Finally, we return the generated system architecture as a string.

```python
def create_system_architecture(user_input):
    """
    This function creates a system architecture based on user input.
    
    Args:
        user_input (str): The user input for the system architecture.
        
    Returns:
        str: The output of the system architecture.
    """
    
    # TODO: Implement your function here
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

Documentation:
The function takes in one argument `user_input` which is a string representing the user's input for the system architecture. The function returns a string representing the output of the system architecture.

Type Hints:
The function has type annotations to indicate what types of inputs it expects and what types of outputs it produces.

Error Handling:
If the user inputs an invalid or non-string value for `user_input`, the function raises a `NotImplementedError`. This ensures that the function does not crash if the user inputs something unexpected.

Detailed Explanation:
The function first checks whether the user input is a valid string. If it is not, it raises a `NotImplementedError`. This ensures that the function only works with strings as input.

Next, the function uses a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the function. If an exception occurs, the function raises a `NotImplementedError`. This ensures that the function never crashes due to unexpected errors.

Finally, the function returns a string representing the output of the system architecture.

```

Documentation:
The function takes in a user input string representing a system architecture as its argument. The function first checks that the input is a string and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. If the input is valid, the function splits the input into components and configurations using a comma as the delimiter. Each component is split into two parts: the component name and the configuration value. The function then loops through each component and configuration pair and checks that they are valid. If any validation fails, an exception is raised. Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing all system components and their respective configurations.
